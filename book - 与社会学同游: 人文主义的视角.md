    > 对人生阅历的调整和重构多半是不自觉的，<br>然而重新解释人生阅历、改变世界观、改信另一种宗教却是刻意为之的。

    > 以社会学里一个非常重要的概念“阶级”为例，
    > > Take for an example the concept of *class*, a very important one in sociology.
    
    > 在日常话语里，这个词的意义数以十计：收入等级、种族、族群、权力集团、智能等级等。
    > >  There must be dozens of meanings that this term may have in common speech --- income brackets, races, ethnic groups, power cliques, intelligence ratings, and many others.
    
    > 显而易见，倘若社会学家的研究工作要达到任何程度的科学意义上的严谨，<br>他就必须要给“阶级”这个词下一个精确的、没有歧义的定义。
    > > It is obvious that the sociologist must have a precise, unambiguous definition of the concept if his work is to proceed with any degree of scientific rigour.
    
    > 据此，有些社会学家禁不住要发明全新的词语，以避免俗语里的语义陷阱。
    > > In view of these facts, one can understand that some sociologists have been tempted to invent altogether new works to avoid the semantic traps of the vernacular usage.

    > ... that is, a world of motives and forces that could not be understood in terms of the official interpretations of social reality.
    
    > We will not be far off if we see sociological thought as part of what Nietzsche called ‘the art of mistrust’. 
    
    > ... Seeing through things is probably a pretty general function of intelligence, even in primitive societies.

    > 社会学家以科学家的身份工作，<br>他尽力做到客观，控制个人的喜好和偏见，尽量获得清楚的感知，而不是去做规定性的评判。

    > 社会学的认识本身就敌视革命的意识形态，这并不是因为社会学有一种保守的偏向，<br>而是因为它不仅看穿了对现状的幻灭感，而且看穿了对未来的虚幻的期待；
    > > ... that sociological understanding is inimical to revolutionary ideologies, not because it has some sort of conservative bias, but because it sees not only through the illusions of the present status *quo* but also through the illusionary expectations concerning possible futures.
    
    > 须知，虚幻的期待就是革命者习惯性的精神营养。
    > > ... such expectations being the customary spiritual nourishment of the revolutionary.

    > 社会学的视野是放眼于人类生活的广博、开放的视野，是摆脱了束缚的视野。<br><br>最优秀的社会学家能够欣赏奇乡异土，<br>他的内心向无限丰富的人类潜力开放，
    >> 他热情追求新的视野，追求人类意义的新世界。

    > It can be said that the first wisdom of sociology is this --- things are not what they seem.
    
    > This too is a deceptively simple statement.<br>It ceases to be simple after a while. Social reality turns out to have many layers of meaning.
    
    > The discovery of each new layer changes the perception of the whole.

    > Statistical data by themselves do not make sociology.
    > > They become sociology only when they are sociologically interpreted, put within a theoretical frame of reference that is sociological. Simple couting, or even correlating different items that one counts, is not sociology.
    
    > The interpretation, however must be broader than the data themselves. So the sociologist cannot arrest himeself at the frequency tables of premarital petting or extramarital pederasty.
    > > These enumerations are meaningful to him only in terms of their much broader implications for an understanding of institutions and values in our society.
    
- 0x06 
    > People who like to avoid shocking discoveries, who prefer to believe that society is just what they were taught in Sunday School, who like the safety of the rules and the maxims of what Alfred Schuetz has called the ‘world-taken-for-granted’, should stay away from sociology.
    
     > People who feel no temptation before closed doors, who have no curiosity about human beings, who are content to admire scenery without wondering about the people who lived in those houses on the other side of that river, should probably also stay away from sociology.
     
     > They will find it unpleasant, at any rate,**unrewarding**.

    > The world is big enough to hold all kinds and there is no logical priority for one interest as against another.
    
    > But the world ‘pastime’ is weak in describing what we mean.
    
    > Sociology is more like a passion.
    
    > The sociological perspective is more like a demon that possesses one, <br>that drives one compellingly, again and again, to the questions that are its own.

    > The fundamental sociological problem is 
    > > not crime but the law, 
    > > > not divorce but marriage, 
    > > > > not revolution but government,
    > > > > > not racial discrimination but racially defined stratification.

    > 我们的主张是，其中的一些新词语是不可或缺的。
    > > We would contend, then, that some of these neologisms have been necessary.
    
    > 然而我们又主张，<br>只要稍加努力，我们就可以用明白晓畅的英语表达社会学里的大多数概念和意义；
    > > We would also contend, however, that most sociology can be presented in intelligible English with but a little effort and that a good deal of contemporary ‘sociologese’ can be understood as a self-conscious mystification.

    > 很大一部分社会学研究关注的, <br>仍然是对社会生活细枝末节的小小剖析，和广阔范围内的理论关怀丝毫不搭界，这也是事实。<br><br>只需匆匆一瞥，扫描一下主要社会学刊物的目录，<br>看看社会学研讨会上宣读的论文目录，你就可以证实此言不虚。

    > The political and economic structure of American academic life encourages this pattern, and not only in sociology.
    > > Colleges and universities are normally administrated by very busy people with little time or inclination to delve into the esoterica produced by their scholarly employees.<br><br>Yet these administrators are called upon to make decisions concerning the hiring and firing. 
    > > > What criteria should they use in these decisions?<br>They cannot be expected to read what their professors write, having no time for such activities and, especially in the more technical disciplines, lack the necessary qualifications to judge the material.

    > The sociologist moves in the common world of men, close to what most of them would call *real*.
    
    > The categories he employs in his analyses are only refinements of the categories by which other man live --- power, class, status, race, ethnicity. 
    
    > As a result, there is a deceptive simplicity and obviousness about some sociological investigations. 
    > > One reads them, nods at the familiar scene, remarks that one has heard all this before and don’t people have better things to do than to waste their time on truisms ...
    
    > ... until one is suddenly brought up against an insight that radically questions everything one had previously assumed about this familiar scene. 
    
    > This is the point at which one begins to sense the excitement of sociology.

    > For the lawyer the essential thing to understand is how the law looks upon a certain type of criminal. 
    
    > For the sociologist it is equally important to see ***how the criminal looks at the law***.

    > ... that an individual may alternate back and forth between logically contradictory meaning systems.
    
    > Each time, the meaning system he enters provides him with an interpretation of his existence and of his world, 
    > > including in this interpretation an explanation of the meaning system he has abandoned. 
    
    > Also, the meaning system provides him with tools to combat his own doubts.
    > > Catholic confessional discipline, Communist ‘autocriticism’, and the psychoanalytic techniques of coping with ‘resistance’ all fulfill the same purpose of preventing alternation out of particular meaning system, allowing the individual to interpret his own doubts in terms derived from the system itself, thus keeping him within it.
