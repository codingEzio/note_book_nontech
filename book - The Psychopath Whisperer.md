# Chapter 01 
### author’s intention
> During my seven-year tenure at RHC, over 95 percent of inmates volunteered for research. 

> And so my career was under way, 
> > *interviewing hundreds of inmates*, <br>*cataloging their life histories*, <br>*assessing their symptoms and personality traits*, 
> > > and eventually, *studying their brains*.
    
# Chapter 02 
### Psychosis versus Psychopathy 
- **Psychosis** is a fragmentation of the mind, <br>leading to symptoms that include hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thoughts. 
- ... psychotic symptoms are not typically observed in psychopaths.
    > Indeed, it was the **absence of psychotic symptoms** <br>that originally differentiated psychopaths from other patients in mental hospitals.
    
### About *Freud*’s theory
- Freud’s psychodynamic theory in general and psychoanalytic treatment <br>in particular quickly fell under heavy criticism when it was pointed out that it was not a theory at all; 
- That is, *psychodynamic theory* <br>does not make any predictions, and hence does not have any testable hypotheses.

### Hare Psychopathy Checklist 
- ... since the development of the *Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised*, 
    > we have had more than twenty years of research using the same instrument, <br>and a very large literature has developed in the scientific community confirming its reliability and validity.
    
- Many studies have confirmed that <br>psychopathy can be reliably assessed with the *Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised*.

- It is this literature that forms the scientific backbone for the remainder of this book.

### Implementing the *H.P.C.*
- To complete the Psychopathy Checklist, a trained clinician needs to do both <br>a detailed semistructured **interview** of the client that lasts approximately 2hrs and a collateral **file review**.

- Files typically include 
    > *police reports*, *social worker assessments*, <br>details on *family dynamics*, *employment history*, <br>*education*, *relationships*, *childhood*, *adolescence*, and *criminal history*.
    
### Defining *mental illness*
- Determining a patient’s diagnosis is usually <br>the first step toward determining the best course of treatment. 
- However, defining mental illness is a complicated process, <br>and I always teach my students that they need to **go beyond the DSM**.

- That is, the DSM is a good starting point, 
    > but if you really want to be on the cutting edge <br>of the science of mental illness or developing new treatments, 
    > > you must educate yourself about <br>the strengths and weaknesses of any psychiatric diagnosis.
    
- Moreover, the DSM is an evolving document <br>that is shaped by science, economics, and politics (not necessarily in that order). 

- Thus, it is incumbent upon researchers that 
    > they understand the history of the mental illness they are studying <br>and learn how the illness has been assessed in previous iterations of the DSM.
    
# Chapter 03 
### Start 
- My <small>( author )</small> goal in this chapter is to offer readers <br>a window into how scientists assess psychopathic traits in an individual. <small>( 详述 Checklist 中的每一条 )</small>
- Typically, the Psychopathy Checklist is 
    > part of the risk assessment of criminal offenders, <br>but the checklist is also being used in other parts of the legal system, 
    > > including *custody disputes*, *divorce court*, and other *adversarial processes*. 
- The assessment of these traits is <br>not as simple as it might seem, and the results that follow might be surprising.
