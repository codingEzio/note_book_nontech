    > *Once I get on a puzzle, I can’t get off.* <br><br>*If my mother’s friend had said, “Never mind, it’s too much work*,” <br>*I’d have blown my top, because I want to beat this damn thing, as long as I’ve gone this far*. <br>*I can’t just leave it after I’ve found out so much about it*. <br><br>*I have to keep going to find out ultimately what is the matter with it in the end.*

    > 文章我是写完了，可我的好奇心还在继续，<br>在我去睡觉的时候，还是坚持观察我自己这种搞法。<br>一天晚上，我正在做梦，我意识到我在梦中正在观察自己呢。<br><br>我把一切都一股脑儿地弄进了睡眠本身当中！
    > > *After I had written the theme I continued to be curious*, <br>*and I kept practicing this watching myself as I went to sleep*. <br>*One night, while I was having a dream, I realized I was observing myself in the dream*. <br><br>*I had gotten all the way down into the sleep itself* !

    > 我总是这么傻乎乎的。我从来不知道自己在跟谁讲话。我总是为物理学操心。<br>如果那个想法看起来糟糕，我就说它看起来糟糕。<br>如果它看起来好，我就说它看起来好。我不会拐弯抹角。<br><br>
我总像这样过日子。这很好，很快乐——但愿你也能这么办。<br>在我的一生中，我很幸运，可以这么办。
    > > *I was always dumb in that way. I never knew who I was talking to. <br>I was always worried about the physics. <br>If the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy. <br>If it looked good, I said it looked good. Simple proposition.*<br><br>
*I’ve always lived that way. It’s nice, it’s pleasant–if you can do it. <br>I’m lucky in my life that I can do this.*

    > “What’s the matter, Dick?”<br><br>I touched my finger to my forehead.<br><br>
He said, “No!”<br><br>
“Yes!”<br><br>
He cried, “No-o-o-o-o-o-o!!!” <br>and he laughed so hard that the roof of the General Electric Company nearly came off.
