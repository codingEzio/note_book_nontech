# Preface 

- quotes of *Jacob Bronowski*
    > *Dream or nightmare, we have to live our experience as it is, and we have to live it awake*. <br>*We live in a world which is penetrated through and through by science and which is both whole and real*.<br> ***We cannot turn it into a game simply by taking sides***.
    
- ... the declaration of a First Cause still leaves open the question, 
    > “Who created the creator?” After all, <br>what is the difference between arguing in favor of an eternally existing creator versus an eternally existing universe without one? 

- ... we may never have enough empirical information to resolve this question unambiguously. <br>But the fact that a universe from nothing is even plausible is certainly significant, at least to me.

- Science has been effective at further our understanding of nature beaucase the scientific ethos is based on three key principles:
    + *follow the evidence wherever it leads*;
    + *if one has a theory,one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much one tries to prove that it is right*;
    + *the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, <br>not the comfort one derives from one’s priori beliefs, nor the beauty of elegance one ascribes to one’s theoretical models*.
